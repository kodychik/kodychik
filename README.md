# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! üåü

## About Me
Hello! I'm a final year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, balancing rigorous academic projects and exciting side hustles. With a passion for entrepreneurship and innovation, I strive to make the world a better place through technology and creativity.

## Current Endeavors
### Machine Learning Intern at C12.ai (Shanghai) - 05/2024 to 09/2024
At C12.ai, I'm diving deep into the world of Machine Learning, working with cutting-edge technologies like OpenAI, Langchain, and LlamaIndex. My focus is on developing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vision-Language Models (VLM) using ChromaDB as the open-source vector database. This technology aims to power an intelligent robotic chemist. Along the way, I'm exploring numerous embedding, retrieval, and reranking combinations with state-of-the-art models from HuggingFace and Cohere.

### Passion for Finance and Startups
I have a deep fascination with finance, particularly in the realm of startup funding. I've attended multiple startup events and have been part of two startups so far, where I gained invaluable insights into the entrepreneurial journey and the challenges of building a successful company.
